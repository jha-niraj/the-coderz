              To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
               1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
               2. The Docker daemon pulled the 'hello-world' image from the Docker Hub.

                  executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
               4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
                  to your terminal.

                "content": "The Docker CLI interacts with the Docker Engine, which consists of three components: the CLI, a REST API, and the Docker daemon. When you execute a command like `docker container run`, the CLI sends a request to the daemon via the REST API. The daemon manages images, containers, and other resources. While Docker has over 50 commands, only a handful are commonly used, such as `docker container run`, which creates a container from an image and downloads the image if not already available.",

                "content": "To manage Docker containers and images effectively, you need to understand key commands:\n\n1. **List Containers**: Use `docker container ls` to see running containers and `docker container ls -a` to include stopped ones.\n2. **Remove Containers**: Containers can be removed using `docker container rm <container_name_or_id>`. You can also use `docker container prune` to remove all stopped containers.\n3. **Remove Images**: Use `docker image rm <image_name>` to delete an image. If the image is in use by a container, it must be removed first.\n4. **Prune Unused Resources**: Use `docker image prune` to remove dangling images or `docker system prune` to clear unused containers, networks, and images.\n\nTo avoid blocking input, run containers in detached mode using the `-d` flag. For example, running `docker run -d nginx` starts the container in the background. Containers can be stopped with `docker container stop <name_or_id>` before removal.",
