Sanitization ensures that only safe and valid data is processed, thus improving the overall security of your website.",

                "content": "PHP provides various built-in functions that help sanitize data before processing it. One of the most commonly used functions is `filter_var()`, which can sanitize input based on predefined filters. For example, `FILTER_SANITIZE_EMAIL` removes unwanted characters from an email address to ensure it adheres to a valid format, while `FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING` removes special characters that may be used in an XSS attack. These filters help ensure that the data entered by the user is safe to use in your application.",

PHP provides `FILTER_SANITIZE_URL` for sanitizing URLs and `FILTER_SANITIZE_FULL_SPECIAL_CHARS` for encoding HTML special characters. This prevents attackers from injecting malicious scripts into your website. For instance, the use of `htmlspecialchars()` is a common approach to convert special characters like `<`, `>`, and `&` into their HTML entities, which prevents browsers from interpreting them as code.",
